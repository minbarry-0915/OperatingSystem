This is another test case of autojudge.

In this example, the target program is ``substr.c``, which receives a text line and two integers b and e and subsequently prints out the substring of the given text line from b to e.

There are five test inputs for ``substr.c`` in the ``in`` directory. The corresponding expected outputs are found in the ``ans`` directory.

You will find that ``substr.c`` produces the correct result with ``in1.txt``, whereas it causes errors with the other four inputs.
